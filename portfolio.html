                        <p> Hello! My name is <span class="color"><b>Milan Oli</b></span>, and I am a passionate and
                            motivated Class 12 student from Rajapur-6,
                            Pahadinagar (Kuniya), Bardiya, Nepal. Currently, I am pursuing my studies in the field of
                            Physical Science, but my true passion lies in web development.
                        </p>
                        <p> Ever since I was introduced to the world of coding, I have been captivated by the endless
                            possibilities that it offers. My journey as
                            a web developer began with learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allowed me to create
                            interactive and visually appealing websites. I enjoy the process of transforming ideas into
                            functional
                            and user-friendly interfaces, and the satisfaction of seeing my work come to life on the
                            web.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While studying Physical Science has provided me with a strong foundation in scientific
                            principles, I have taken it upon myself to dive deeper into web development by continuously
                            learning
                            and expanding my skill set. I have explored frameworks
                            like Bootstrap and libraries like jQuery to enhance my ability to create responsive and
                            dynamic web pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from technical skills, I believe that effective communication and collaboration are
                            crucial in delivering successful web projects. I have actively wanted to participated in
                            group projects . I am always eager to learn from others and embrace feedback as a means of
                            personal and professional growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the future, my goal is to secure a job as a web developer where I can apply my skills and
                            contribute to creating innovative digital experiences. I am driven by a desire to
                            continuously evolve as a developer and keep up with the latest trends and technologies in
                            the industry.
